Dear Hiring Manager, 

Your job posting called out to me because this particular position, as described, is such a perfect match with my skills, as you will see when you review my resume. 

My educational background has prepared me for the role of a Software Engineer.  In particular, my study of Algorithms , Databases and experience in programming with JAVA and Python has given me a solid background so that I can work on developing continuous integration 
infrastructure, GUI tools, web apps, and automatic code generation tools
 for embedded software systems. Having successfully completed my Bachelors in Computer Engineering, I
am currently pursuing my Masters Degree in Electrical and Computer
Engineering. The skills earned during my academic career would enable me to build tools that enhance the efficiency of the 
entire embedded software development organization through improved code 
reuse, eliminating redundancy, and automation.

I am certain that my resume will give you a greater understanding of my qualifications for this exciting opportunity. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my credentials and how my expertise can help your organization. 

I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to work with and learn from you and your talented team. I look forward to speaking with you soon.

Sincerely,
Gandhar Vaidya.
